# CKA-Challenges
Repository with my own challenges for the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator CKA LFS-258 Exam.](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/)
The environment is based on https://github.com/wuestkamp/cka-example-environments with some modifications where additional nodes were added and also a NFS server.
The custom setup that was modified from the original one can be found here [Kubernetes Cluster](https://github.com/nfonseca/cka-example-environments.git). On this setup you will have 4 VMs (1 Master and 3 Worker Nodes)
